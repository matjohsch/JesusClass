  volume = {1},
  edition = {1},
  abstract = {This book presents a variety of computational methods used to solve
	dynamic problems in economics and finance. It emphasizes practical
	numerical methods rather than mathematical proofs and focuses on
	techniques that apply directly to economic analyses. The examples
	are drawn from a wide range of subspecialties of economics and finance,
	with particular emphasis on problems in agricultural and resource
	economics, macroeconomics, and finance. The book also provides an
	extensive Web-site library of computer utilities and demonstration
	programs. The book is divided into two parts. The first part develops
	basic numerical methods, including linear and nonlinear equation
	methods, complementarity methods, finite-dimensional optimization,
	numerical integration and differentiation, and function approximation.
	The second part presents methods for solving dynamic stochastic models
	in economics and finance, including dynamic programming, rational
	expectations, and arbitrage pricing models in discrete and continuous
	time. The book uses MATLAB to illustrate the algorithms and includes
	a utilities toolbox to help readers develop their own computational
	economics applications.},
